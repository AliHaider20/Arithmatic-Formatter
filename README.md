Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. For example, "235 + 52" becomes:
```
  235
+  52
-----
  287

My task was to build a function to eval this equation with handling some type of exceptions and the output should be in the above format. 
I have done this task in freecodecamp's Scienctific computing with python course as a capstone project.

Main.py >> This program evaluates all the test cases available in the test_module.py file.
If you want to test or evaluate some cases you can write in test_module.py file.

**Note** >> There are still some changes yet to be made.
